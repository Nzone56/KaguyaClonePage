But in reality, he has no romantic experience whatsoever when a male student comes to him for advice regarding a crush. In a desperate attempt to cover his lack of experience and to protect his dignity as the Student Council President, he takes on the student’s request and claims, “Leave it to me!” For Kaguya, who has been eavesdropping, this becomes an excellent opportunity for her to find out Shirogane’s views on love.
