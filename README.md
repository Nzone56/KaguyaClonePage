## Description

This project is a recreation of the official Kaguya-sama: Love is War website, a popular anime and manga series. The cloned website includes various sections such as the home page, anime information, characters, image gallery, and more. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of modern technologies like React, Vite, and MUI to build an attractive and responsive user interface. Additionally, it showcases the evolution of the website throughout its seasons, as each one presents a unique and characteristic design while maintaining the essence of the series.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The first season is currently available, and a landing page leading to the season selection has been added. Please note that the clone is not 100% exact, as some changes have been made for personal preference. The project is not yet responsive, and some details are yet to be completed (refer to the 'TODO' list).
